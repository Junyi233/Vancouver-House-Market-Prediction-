# Vancouver-House-Market-Prediction-
### Project Overview:

In this project, I developed a **multiple linear regression model** to predict the sale price of houses in Vancouver.

### Methods:

- The project began by dividing the dataset into two distinct sets: a training set and a validation set. The training set was used to develop the predictive model.
- The project involved conducting **exploratory data analysis**, including visualizations that showcased the relationships between the variables.
- The main part of the project presented the results of the **best model**, referred to as the final model.
- The final model was selected based on several considerations, such as ensuring that assumptions were met, assessing goodness of fit to the training set, evaluating the model's complexity and variable selection, and examining its performance in predicting new data.
- Before arriving at the final model, the project also considered alternative **candidate models**.

### Final Remarks:

- The project concluded with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the final model. Recommendations were provided to address any identified limitations.
- The predictive model aimed to provide valuable insights for real estate professionals in Vancouver, enabling them to make informed decisions while representing both sellers and buyers of houses.
